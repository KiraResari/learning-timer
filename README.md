# Learning Timer

A learning project where I experiment with generative AI to create a  flutter app, comparing ChatGPT and Bard, seeing what results I get from  the same input prompt, and how many corrections are required to get the desired result.

I am going to include two log files to keep track of my prompts.

* Bard Log.md
* ChatGPT Log.md

I am going to make one commit after each prompt cycle, which means one update to the Bard version, and one update to the ChatGPT version simultaneously (unless one of those two versions is already perfect).
