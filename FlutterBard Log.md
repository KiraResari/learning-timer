# Round 1

## Prompt

Please write me a flutter app that fulfills the following user story and requirements:

As someone who learns things in his free time, I want a program that can help me balance learning time with relaxation time.

Requirements:
* A timer that can count up and down
* The timer should display time in the format `hh:mm:ss`
* If the time is negative, the time should be displayed in the format `-hh:mm:ss`, and the font should be red
* A button to make the timer count up
* A button to make the timer count down
* A button to stop the timer at its current value
* A button to reset the timer to 00:00:00

```

 Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)



To run the app, you can save the code as `timer_app.dart` and then run the following command in the terminal:



```
flutter run
```



This will launch the app in the emulator or on your device.

## Result

A few compile errors, as well as critical functionality issues

### Compile issues

* Library 'dart:async' was not imported
* Declaration `Timer _timer` is invalid ("Non-nullable instance field '_timer' must be initialized.")
* Trying to set non-nullable field to null: `_timer = null;`
* Redundant checks for `_timer != null` ("The operand can't be null, so the condition is always true. ")
* Wrong assignment to `onPressed`: `onPressed: onPressed,` ("The argument type 'Function' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'void Function()?'.")

### Program issues

* Missing button for "Count Up"
* "Count Down" button does nothing

### Notably working things

* App starts with timer stopped
* Timer is in correct format
